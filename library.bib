abstract = {During the past few decades, several new classes of superconductors have been discovered that do not appear to be related to traditional superconductors. The source of the superconductivity of these materials is likely different from the electron-ion interactions that are at the heart of conventional superconductivity. Developing a rigorous theory for any of these classes of materials has proven to be a difficult challenge and will remain one of the major problems in physics in the decades to come.},

abstract = {A flux qubit biased at its symmetry point shows a minimum in the energy splitting (the gap), providing protection against flux noise. We have fabricated a qubit of which the gap can be tuned fast and have coupled this qubit strongly to an LC oscillator. We show full spectroscopy of the qubit-oscillator system and generate vacuum Rabi oscillations. When the gap is made equal to the oscillator frequency $\nu$(osc) we find the largest vacuum Rabi splitting of 0.1 $\nu$(osc). Here being at resonance coincides with the optimal coherence of the symmetry point.},

@article{Anderson1972,
abstract = {An overview of the low-energy dislocation structure (LEDS) theory of low-temperature, that is non-creep, dislocation-based crystal plasticity is presented, as systematically developed over the past 35 years. It is ultimately based on G. I. Taylor's 1934 theory of work hardening wherein he assumed that stress application causes the essentially instantaneous athermal generation of dislocation structures which are in equilibrium with the applied stress and which on stress release and reversal are stable up to the previously highest stress magnitude. As will be shown, at least in principle even though many details are still lacking, the following phenomena of crystal plasticity are readily explained by means of the LEDS theory: (1) the four stages of work hardening; (2) the shape of the stress-strain curve; (3) the temperature dependence of work hardening; (4) the low-temperature strain rate dependence of the flow stress; (5) the difference between 'planar' and 'wavy' glide materials (as exemplified by ?-brass and copper respectively); (6) the empirical relationship D = KGb/? between dislocation cell size and flow stress; (7) grain-boundary hardening; (8) alloy hardening including solid-solution, precipitation and phase-boundary hardening; (9) slip lines and slip bands; (10) the evolution of the dislocation structures from stages I to IV; (11) deformation texture evolution; (12) work softening; (13) the thermodynamics of dislocation storage; (14) recovery, creep and recrystallization; (15) the development of dislocation structures in fatigue. All these are explained effortlessly on the basis of only the known properties of glide dislocations and the second law of thermodynamics, as expressed in the LEDS hypothesis, to wit that, among the structures which are in equilibrium with the applied tractions and accessible to the dislocations, those are formed which most nearly minimize the stored energy. (See Note added in proof at end of this paper.) The alternative 'self-organizing dislocation' model of crystal plasticity assumes plastic deformation to be due to individual thermally activated processes, which are treatable by the thermodynamics of energy-flow-through systems. It can be traced back to the early theory by R. Becker in 1925 and 1926 and still has to yield significant results.},

abstract = {Over the last 30 years, metrology laboratories have used the quantum behavior of the Josephson effect to greatly improve voltage metrology. The following article reviews the history and present status of the research and development for Josephson voltage standards. Specifically, the technology and performance of voltage standards that have quantum accuracy is explained in detail, as is their impact on a wide range of electrical metrology applications, primarily those for dc and ac voltage measurements. The physics of the Josephson effect will be presented and the importance of quantum-based electrical standards will be discussed. A detailed explanation of the operation of the conventional Josephson voltage standard and its use for dc applications will be presented, including a description of the most important results. The latter sections of this paper describe recent efforts to apply the Josephson effect to ac voltage and other electrical metrology applications. Advanced voltage standard systems have been developed that provide new features such as stable, programmable dc voltages and quantum-accurate ac waveform synthesis. The superconducting technology and integrated circuit designs for these systems will be described. Two different systems have dramatically improved precision measurements for audio-frequency voltages and for electric power metrology.},

The pair distribution function and therefore the structures of the systems studied are affected by temperature close to and above the melting point through migrations of atoms from the first shell in the pair distribution function. The dynamics of atomic pairs in the short-time regime in liquid aluminium may be said to be governed by the potential of mean force, which depends on the static structure of liquid Al at all investigated temperatures. A polynomial dependence ofD on density and temperature was observed in contradiction to Arrhenius law. The shear viscosities of the systems studied are largely nonlinear. It was observed that the soft sphere potential used in our calculations overestimates the Stoke-Einstein relation.},

@article{Voloshin2011,
abstract = {The study of hydration, folding, and interaction of proteins by volumetric measurements has been promoted by recent advances in the development of highly sensitive instrumentations. However, the separation of the measured apparent volumes into contributions from the protein and the hydration water, V(app) = V(int) + $\Delta$V, is still challenging, even with the detailed microscopic structural information from molecular simulations. By the examples of the amyloidogenic polypeptides hIAPP and A$\beta$42 in aqueous solution, we analyze molecular dynamics simulation runs for different temperatures, using the Voronoi-Delaunay tessellation method. This method allows a parameter free determination of the intrinsic volume V(int) of complex solute molecules without any additional assumptions. For comparison, we also use fused sphere calculations, which deliver van der Waals and solute accessible surface volumes as special cases. The apparent volume V(app) of the solute molecules is calculated by different approaches, using either a traditional distance based selection of hydration water or the construction of sequential Voronoi shells. We find an astonishing coincidence with the predictions of a simple empirical approach, which is based on experimentally determined amino acid side chain contributions (Biophys. Chem.1999, 82, 35). The intrinsic volumes of the polypeptides are larger than their apparent volumes and also increase with temperature. This is due to a negative contribution of the hydration water $\Delta$V to the apparent volume. The absolute value of this contribution is less than 10\% of the intrinsic volume for both molecules and decreases with temperature. Essential volumetric differences between hydration water and bulk water are observed in the nearest neighborhood of the solute only, practically in the first two Delaunay sublayers of the first Voronoi shell. This also helps to understand the pressure dependence of the partial molar volumes of proteins.},

abstract = {We report spectroscopic measurements of discrete two-level systems (TLSs) coupled to a dc SQUID phase qubit with a 16 mum2 area Al/AlOx/Al junction. Applying microwaves in the 10 GHz to 11 GHz range, we found eight avoided level crossings with splitting sizes from 10 MHz to 200 MHz and spectroscopic lifetimes from 4 ns to 160 ns. Assuming the transitions are from the ground state of the composite system to an excited state of the qubit or an excited state of one of the TLS states, we fit the location and spectral width to get the energy levels, splitting sizes and spectroscopic coherence times of the phase qubit and TLSs. The distribution of splittings is consistent with non-interacting individual charged ions tunneling between random locations in the tunnel barrier and the distribution of lifetimes is consistent with the AlOx in the junction barrier having a frequency-independent loss tangent. To check that the charge of each TLS couples independently to the voltage across the junction, we also measured the spectrum in the 20-22 GHz range and found tilted avoided level crossings due to the second excited state of the junction and states in which both the junction and a TLS were excited.},

@article{Faoro2005,
abstract = {A theoretical interpretation of the recent experiments of Astafiev et. al. on the T1-relaxation rate in Josephson Charge Qubits is proposed. The experimentally observed reproducible nonmonotonic dependence of T1 on the splitting EJ of the qubit levels suggests further specification of the previously proposed models of the background charge noise. From our point of view the most promising is the ``Andreev fluctuator'' model of the noise. In this model the fluctuator is a Cooper pair that tunnels from a superconductor and occupies a pair of localized electronic states. Within this model one can naturally explain both the average linear T1(EJ) dependence and the irregular fluctuations. The role of fluctuators in the formation of strong resonant peaks in this dependence is also discussed.},

abstract = {Although Josephson junction qubits show great promise for quantum computing, the origin of dominant decoherence mechanisms remains unknown. Improving the operation of a Josephson junction based phase qubit has revealed microscopic two-level systems or resonators within the tunnel barrier that cause decoherence. We report spectroscopic data that show a level splitting characteristic of coupling between a two-state qubit and a two-level system. Furthermore, we show Rabi oscillations whose "coherence amplitude" is significantly degraded by the presence of these spurious microwave resonators. The discovery of these resonators impacts the future of Josephson qubits as well as existing Josephson technologies.},

abstract = {We have investigated planar metal-insulator-metal tunnel junctions with aluminium oxide as the dielectricum. These oxide barriers were grown on an aluminium electrode in pure oxygen at room temperature till saturation. By applying the Simmons model we derived discrete widths of the tunnelling barrier, separated by Ds 0.38 nm. This corresponds to the addition of single layers of oxygen atoms. The minimum thickness of s0 0.54 nm is then due to a double layer of oxygen. We found a strong and systematic dependence of the barrier height on the barrier thickness. Breakdown fields up to 5 GV m?1 were reached. They decreased strongly with increasing barrier thickness. Electrical breakdown could be described by a metal-insulator like transition of the dielectric barrier due to the large density of tunnelling electrons.},

abstract = {Experimental results for passive tracer dispersion in the turbulent surface layer under stable conditions are presented. In this case, the dispersion of tracer particles is determined by the interplay of three mechanisms: relative dispersion (celebrated Richardson's mechanism), shear dispersion (particle separation due to variation of the mean velocity field) and specific surface-layer dispersion (induced by the gradient of the energy dissipation rate in the turbulent surface layer). The latter mechanism results in the rather slow (ballistic) law for the mean squared particle separation. Based on a simplified Langevin equation for particle separation we found that the ballistic regime always dominates at large times. This conclusion is supported by our extensive atmospheric observations. Exit-time statistics are derived from the experimental dataset and show a reasonable match with the simple dimensional asymptotes for different mechanisms of tracer dispersion, as well as predictions of the multifractal model and experimental data from other sources.},

abstract = {We have observed a few distinct anomalous avoided level crossings and voltage dependent transitions in the excited state spectrum of an Al/AlOx/Al Cooper-pair box (CPB). The device was measured at 40 mK in the 15 - 50 GHz frequency range. We find that a given level crosses the CPB spectrum at two different gate voltages; the frequency and splitting size of the two crossings differ and the splitting size depends on the Josephson energy of the CPB. We show that this behavior is not only consistent with the CPB being coupled to discrete charged "two-level" quantum systems which move atomic distances in the CPB junctions but that the spectra provide new information about the fluctuators, which is not available from phase qubit spectra of anomalous avoided levels. In particular by fitting a model Hamiltonian to our data, we extract microscopic parameters for each fluctuator, including well asymmetry, tunneling amplitude, and the minimum hopping distance for each fluctuator. The tunneling rates range from less than 3.5 to 13 GHz, which represent values between 5\% and 150\% of the well asymmetry, and the dipole moments give a minimum hopping distance of 0.3 to 0.8 Anstrom. We have also found that these discrete two-level systems have a pronounced effect on the relaxation time (T1) of the quantum states of the CPB and hence can be a source of dissipation for superconducting quantum bits.},

In the superconducting state these devices have revealed a strong subgap current leakage. Analyzing Cooper-pair and quasiparticle currents across the devices, we conclude that the strong suppression of the subgap resistance comparing with conventional tunnel junctions originates from a universal bimodal distribution of transparencies across the Al-oxide barrier proposed earlier by Schep and Bauer. We suggest a simple physical explanation of its source in the nanometer-thick oxide films relating it to strong local barrier-height fluctuations which are generated by oxygen vacancies in thin aluminum oxide tunnel barriers formed by thermal oxidation.},

In this work we study a phase qubit, in which we induce Rabi oscillations by resonant microwave driving. When the qubit is tuned close to the resonance with an individual TLF and the Rabi driving is strong enough (Rabi frequency of order of the qubit-TLF coupling), interesting 4-level dynamics are observed. The experimental data shows a clear asymmetry between biasing the qubit above or below the fluctuator's level-splitting. Theoretical analysis indicates that this asymmetry is due to an effective coupling of the TLF to the external microwave field induced by the higher qubit levels.},

abstract = {A generalized version of the VoronoiDelaunay method is used to study relatively large intermolecular voids in a model of the hydrated DMPC bilayer, obtained from all-atom Monte Carlo simulation. Application of the original version of the method for molecular systems has been hampered by the fact that these systems geometrically represent ensembles of partially overlapping spheres of different radii. The generalized version of the method is based on using the additively weighed Voronoi diagram, representing the locus of spatial points being equally far from the surface rather than the center of the corresponding pair of atoms. This version of the VoronoiDelaunay method can be readily used to reveal and analyze voids accessible for probes of different radii even in rather complex molecular systems. When the properties of the voids present in the simulated DMPC membrane are investigated, their shape, size, and orientation have been analyzed in detail in the different regions of the membrane located at different depths along the membrane normal axis. The characteristics of the voids are found to be different in different regions of the bilayer, namely (i) at the middle of the membrane, in the region of the hydrophobic lipid tails, (ii) in the region of the hydrophilic zwitterionic headgroups, and (iii) in the region of the bulklike water adjacent to the bilayer. The largest and oblong voids are found in the middle of the membrane, with a preferred orientation that is parallel to the bilayer normal axis. A clear correlation between the orientation of the voids and the orientation of the lipid chains is observed. In the bulk water region the fraction of the empty space is even higher than at the middle of the membrane; however, here the voids are distributed more uniformly. Finally, in the high-density region of the hydrophilic headgroups the voids are found, on average, smaller than in the other parts of the system.},

abstract = {The calculation of radial distribution functions (RDFs) from molecular dynamics trajectory data is a common and computationally expensive analysis task. The rate limiting step in the calculation of the RDF is building a histogram of the distance between atom pairs in each trajectory frame. Here we present an implementation of this histogramming scheme for multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). The algorithm features a tiling scheme to maximize the reuse of data at the fastest levels of the GPU's memory hierarchy and dynamic load balancing to allow high performance on heterogeneous configurations of GPUs. Several versions of the RDF algorithm are presented, utilizing the specific hardware features found on different generations of GPUs. We take advantage of larger shared memory and atomic memory operations available on state-of-the-art GPUs to accelerate the code significantly. The use of atomic memory operations allows the fast, limited-capacity on-chip memory to be used much more efficiently, resulting in a fivefold increase in performance compared to the version of the algorithm without atomic operations. The ultimate version of the algorithm running in parallel on four NVIDIA GeForce GTX 480 (Fermi) GPUs was found to be 92 times faster than a multithreaded implementation running on an Intel Xeon 5550 CPU. On this multi-GPU hardware, the RDF between two selections of 1,000,000 atoms each can be calculated in 26.9 seconds per frame. The multi-GPU RDF algorithms described here are implemented in VMD, a widely used and freely available software package for molecular dynamics visualization and analysis.},

abstract = {The properties of the interatomic voids present in fully hydrated dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC)-cholesterol mixed membranes of different compositions are analyzed in detail using a generalized variant of the Voronoi-Delaunay method on the basis of computer simulation results. The systems investigated are chosen from both sides of the DMPC-cholesterol miscibility gap; the pure DMPC bilayer has also been included in the analysis as a reference system. The results obtained show that the empty space is organized in a more compact way, forming larger voids in the presence than in the absence of cholesterol. The voids located in the region of the rigid cholesterol rings become, on average, less spherical, oriented more parallel with the membrane normal axis with increasing cholesterol concentration, whereas an opposite effect of cholesterol is observed in the middle of the membrane among the chain terminal methyl groups. In general, the preferential orientation of the voids is found to strongly correlate with that of the molecules in the hydrocarbon phase of the membranes. The membranes are found to contain rather large voids, the volume of which can be an order of magnitude larger than the largest spherical cavities present in the systems. These voids are elongated or branching channels rather than big empty holes. The voids located among the DMPC and cholesterol molecules are lying preferably parallel with the membrane normal axis. The existence of such empty channels can be of great importance in the cross-membrane permeation of small, uncharged penetrants, in particular, of polar molecules.},

@article{Neeley2008,
abstract = {A quantum computer will require quantum bits (qubits) with good coherence that can be coupled together to form logic gates1, 2. Superconducting circuits offer a novel solution3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 because qubits can be connected in elaborate ways through simple wiring, much like that of conventional integrated circuits. However, this ease of coupling is offset by coherence times shorter than those observed in molecular and atomic systems. Hybrid architectures could help skirt this fundamental trade-off between coupling and coherence by using macroscopic qubits for coupling and atom-based qubits for coherent storage10, 11. Here, we demonstrate the first quantum memory operation12 on a Josephson-phase qubit by transferring an arbitrary quantum state to a two-level state13 (TLS), storing it there for some time, and later retrieving it. The qubit is used to probe the coherence of the TLS by measuring its energy relaxation and dephasing times. Quantum process tomography2, 14 completely characterizes the memory operation, yielding an overall process fidelity of 79\%. Although the uncontrolled distribution of TLSs precludes their direct use in a scalable architecture, the ability to coherently couple a macroscopic device with an atomic-sized system motivates a search for designer molecules that could replace the TLS in future hybrid qubits.},

We show that, in the presence of potential disorder at the metal-insulator interface, some of the metal-induced gap states become localized and produce local moments. A modest level of disorder yields the observed areal density.},

abstract = {The grand canonical Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the adsorption isotherms of water molecules on different types of model soot particles. These soot models are constructed by first removing atoms from onion-fullerene structures in order to create randomly distributed pores inside the soot, and then performing molecular dynamics simulations, based on the reactive adaptive intermolecular reactive empirical bond order (AIREBO) description of the interaction between carbon atoms, to optimize the resulting structures. The obtained results clearly show that the main driving force of water adsorption on soot is the possibility of the formation of new water-water hydrogen bonds with the already adsorbed water molecules. The shape of the calculated water adsorption isotherms at 298 K strongly depends on the possible confinement of the water molecules in pores of the carbonaceous structure. We found that there are two important factors influencing the adsorption ability of soot. The first of these factors, dominating at low pressures, is the ability of the soot of accommodating the first adsorbed water molecules at strongly hydrophilic sites. The second factor concerns the size and shape of the pores, which should be such that the hydrogen bonding network of the water molecules filling them should be optimal. This second factor determines the adsorption properties at higher pressures.},

Our results demonstrate that this loss can be significantly reduced by using better dielectrics and fabricating junctions of small area . With a redesigned phase qubit employing low-loss dielectrics, the energy relaxation rate has been improved by a factor of 20, opening up the possibility of multiqubit gates and algorithms.},

The partitioning algorithm follows the steepest ascent paths along the charge density gradient from grid point to grid point until a charge density maximum is reached. In this paper, we describe how accurate off-lattice ascent paths can be represented with respect to the grid points. This improvement maintains the efficient linear scaling of an earlier version of the algorithm, and eliminates a tendency for the Bader surfaces to be aligned along the grid directions. As the algorithm assigns grid points to charge density maxima, subsequent paths are terminated when they reach previously assigned grid points. It is this grid-based approach which gives the algorithm its efficiency, and allows for the analysis of the large grids generated from plane-wave-based density functional theory calculations.},

We show that the noise is dominated by sharp subgap resonances associated to the formation of pairs of Andreev bound states, thus providing a possible explanation for the spurious two-level systems (microresonators) observed in Josephson junction qubits R.W.

Another implication of our model is that each trapping-center will contribute a sharp dielectric resonance only in the superconducting phase, providing an effective way to validate our results experimentally. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for a qubit interacting with Andreev bound states, establishing a direct connection between phenomenological models and the microscopic parameters of a Fermionic bath.},

abstract = {Noise and decoherence are major obstacles to the implementation of Josephson junction qubits in quantum computing. Recent experiments suggest that two level systems (TLS) in the oxide tunnel barrier are a source of decoherence. We explore two decoherence mechanisms in which these two level systems lead to the decay of Rabi oscillations that result when Josephson junction qubits are subjected to strong microwave driving. (A) We consider a Josephson qubit coupled resonantly to a two level system, i.e., the qubit and TLS have equal energy splittings. As a result of this resonant interaction, the occupation probability of the excited state of the qubit exhibits beating. Decoherence of the qubit results when the two level system decays from its excited state by emitting a phonon. (B) Fluctuations of the two level systems in the oxide barrier produce fluctuations and 1/f noise in the Josephson junction critical current Io. This in turn leads to fluctuations in the qubit energy splitting that degrades the qubit coherence. We compare our results with experiments on Josephson junction phase qubits.},

abstract = {In structurally disordered solids, some atoms or small groups of atoms are able to quantum mechanically tunnel between two nearly equivalent sites. These atomic tunneling systems have been identified as the cause of various low-temperature anomalies of bulk glasses and as a source of decoherence of superconducting qubits where they are sparsely present in the disordered oxide barrier of Josephson junctions. We demonstrated experimentally that minute deformation of the oxide barrier changes the energies of the atomic tunneling systems, and we measured these changes by microwave spectroscopy of the superconducting qubit through coherent interactions between these two quantum systems. By measuring the dependence of the energy splitting of atomic tunneling states on external strain, we verify a central hypothesis of the two-level tunneling model for disordered solids.},

@inproceedings{Nugroho2013,
abstract = {The characterization of low-frequency two level systems (TLS) provides a connection between the generic \$1/f\$ noise in Josephson junctions to the TLSs observed in qubit energy spectroscopy. We present measurements of the tunneling-resistance noise in nanoscale Al/AlO\$\_\{x\}\$/Al shadow evaporated junctions with areas \$<(100\~{}\backslash textrm\{nm\})\^{}\{2\}\$. As the junction area or the temperature is decreased we observed a crossover from ensemble-averaged \$1/f\$ noise to a random telegraph noise from isolated TLSs. From the area threshold for the onset of non-gaussianity, we estimate a density of TLSs in the amorphous AlO\$\_\{x\}\$ barrier consistent with the magnitude of \$1/f\$ noise in larger junctions and the density of high frequency TLSs from qubit spectroscopy. Furthermore we may deduce the potential landscape of the TLSs by characterizing the switching times and signal variance as a function of voltage bias and temperature. In some junctions no fluctuators are active, giving rise to immeasurably small noise signal. We discuss the implication of our findings to qubit coherence times.},

@article{Faoro2007,
abstract = {We analyze data on the critical current and normal state resistance noise in Josephson junctions and argue that the noise in the critical current is due to a mechanism that is absent in the normal state. We estimate the noise produced by conventional Two Level Systems (TLSs) in the insulating barrier and find that it agrees both in magnitude and in temperature dependence with the resistance fluctuations in the normal state but it is not sufficient to explain the critical current noise observed in large superconducting contacts. We propose a novel microscopic mechanism for the noise in the superconducting state in which the noise is due to electron tunneling between weak Kondo states at subgap energies. We argue that the noise produced by this mechanism gives temperature, area dependence and intensity that agree with the data.},

@article{Pires2010,
abstract = {The goal of these notes is to introduce, in a very elementary way, the idea of the anti de-Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence to condensed matter physicists. This theory relates a gravity theory in a (d+1)- dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime to a strongly-coupled d- dimensional quantum field theory living on its boundary. The AdS/CFT correspondence can be used to study finite temperature real time processes, such as response functions and dynamics far from equilibrium in quantum critical points in condensed matter systems. Computation of these quantities is reduced to solving classical gravitational equations in one higher dimension than the original theory.},

@article{Shnirman2005,
abstract = {Recent experiments indicate a connection between the low- and high-frequency noise affecting superconducting quantum systems. We explore the possibilities that both noises can be produced by one ensemble of microscopic modes, made up, e.g., by sufficiently coherent two-level systems (TLS). This implies a relation between the noise power in different frequency domains, which depends on the distribution of the parameters of the TLSs. We show that a distribution, natural for tunneling TLSs, with a log-uniform distribution in the tunnel splitting and linear distribution in the bias, accounts for experimental observations.},
