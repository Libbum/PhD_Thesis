\caption[Potential Projections]{\label{fig:mexhatproj}\lin{1D} double wells (blue, solid) and harmonic wells (red, dashed) can be used to represent simple projections of a \lin{2D} potential onto the $x$ and $y$ axes. Left: two projected double wells is an example of a tetra-well. Right: a combination of one double well and a harmonic well reflects the hemi-tetra- case.}
