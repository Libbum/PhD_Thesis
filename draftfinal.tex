% After I made this file, there has been a major update of the geometry package that should make adding bleeds, etc, way easier. The page dimension specification here is a little bit confusing because it was written before those features existed.
% The idea with the different versions is to keep the same textblock width no matter which version (to avoid rebreaking equations, etc); keep the same textblock height except for the doublespaced gradschool version; headers, footers, margins, blank pages, thumb-indices, etc, can change
